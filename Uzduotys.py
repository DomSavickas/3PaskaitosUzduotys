# TODO 1. Write a program to calculate the Pythagorean Theorem. The Pythagorean theorem must be computed in a function. The required values must be entered by the user. Write data validation exceptions. +
# TODO 2. Write a program to calculate the body mass index. The body mass index must be calculated in the function. Remember to check the correctness of the parameters. The required values must be entered by the user. Write data validation exceptions. +
# TODO 3. Write a function that can accept two parameters: the first is a number and the second is a list of numbers. The function must return: the list average, the maximum and the minimum number, the number of digits in the list smaller and larger than the first parameter.
# TODO 4. Write a decorator for the first assignment function that would multiply all values returned by two and print them.
# TODO 5. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a comma-separated sequence of digits. Create a generator that is fed with two parameters: the first - the user-entered text is converted into a list, and the parameter "stop" with a default value of 2. The generator should form return elements according to the formula: list value * 0.5. The "stop" parameter specifies how many elements to return to the generator. When the number of return items specified in the "stop" parameter is reached, the generator stops working. Write data validity exceptions.
# TODO 6. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number. Recursion should be used to calculate the sum of all numbers from 0 to the entered number and print it out. If you enter 4, then 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 +
